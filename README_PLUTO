a2GEANT PLUTO INPUT

I removed all the mkin format stuff from the "PrimaryGeneratorAction".

Some arrays used in the A2CBOutput format are not filled and I removed
some branches in the output tree. These seemed to contain some kind of true
information. And the beam 4Vector is wrong at the moment.

AcquROOT an run with the mew output of a2geant, but I am sure there are miskates in there.
