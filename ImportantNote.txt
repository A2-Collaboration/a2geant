PID2 does not currently work! Outside volume error when trying to actually run it! Fix this!

PID1 works however! Need to have a look at this.

Removed NestPID class, may need to rename some volumes in PID2 to allow it to correctly work in conjuction with PID3. 

PID2 and PID3 seemed to have problems with overlapping volume names, this appears to be resolved now?

Still get warning that volume LG is completely outside mother volume PIDD2.
